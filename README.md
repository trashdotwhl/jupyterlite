# JupyterLite 

Run here: https://trashdotwhl.github.io/jupyterlite/

A fork of https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo with the README changed.

# Run python code without having to install anything or send data anywhere.

Unlike a typical jupyter notebook, which sends cells to a server to be evaluated, cells in jupyterlite are evaluated in WASM, which means the code/data never leaves your browser.
