# JupyterLite 

An almost unchanged fork of https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo
I added https://pypi.org/project/Levenshtein/ to the requirements to test the process of adding packages.

# Run python code without having to install anything or send data anywhere.

Unlike a typical jupyter notebook, which sends cells to a server to be evaluated, cells in jupyterlite are evaluated in WASM, which means the code/data never leaves your browser. This means you have to trust the code you are writes.
